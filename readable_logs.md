readable logs file is the man-made record while building this repo, it consists the problems and daily records when reviewing 941 subject.

it also consist the rules or protocols when I maintain this repo in different computers, school, home pc, lab pc, etc.

# questions

## questions about code blocks

the references of 941 recommends code blocks as the C/C++ IDE, however when I was trying to change the font style inside the C::B editor, it raise exceptions about cannot found the font file and other errors, the code inside this repo are completed by VS Code, thus you might find some VS Code config file such as task.json.

## questions about how to manage the file structure inside the repo

in data structure sector, each executable file are named as following format

chapter in book / description / subtitle (if it's necessary to exist) .c 

remote code repo cannot find the executable file aka exe file due to the .ignore file, because the exe file in my PC may not run successfully in others on the grounds that exe file need system symbols which are different in different versions of windows to run.

# unsolved

* in linked list which exist a head (aka sentinel) , if I'd like to delete entire linked list, how to delete head, use **ptr or others

question above solved, paper doesn't care the details and others. the way to express algorithm and step is more important.
